# Detection of Melt Ponds on Arctic Sea Ice from Infrared Images

Melt ponds are pools of water on Arctic sea ice that have a strong influence on the Arctic energy budget by increasing the amount of sunlight that is absorbed. 
Accurate quantitative analysis of melt ponds is important for improving Arctic climate model predictions.

This repository develops a segmentation tool that partitions helicopter-borne thermal infrared (TIR) images into sea ice, melt pond, and ocean classes. 
The data were aquired during the PSP131 ATWAICE campaign [1].
The model is a U-net with ResNet34 backbone, pretrained on ImageNet. Current work focusses on the integration of visual imagery into the training.
