# Detection of Melt Ponds on Arctic Sea Ice from Infrared Images

This repository develops a segmentation tool that partitions helicopter-borne thermal infrared (TIR) images into sea ice, melt pond, and ocean classes. 
The data used were aquired during the PSP131 ATWAICE campaign [1]. All training images and masks can be investigated in ```preprocessing_sample.ipynb```.
The model is a U-net with ResNet34 backbone, pretrained on ImageNet. Current work focusses on the integration of visual imagery into the training.

The data used is not published yet.

### Setup
This code requires Python 3.10. Install the required packages using ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

### Quickstart
If you want to use the current optimized model for inference on an image, use the following:

(in progress...)```python -m utils.predict image```.

To fine-tune the model using different hyperparameters or training data:

```python fine_tune.py --pref [pref_name]```, where ```pref_name``` will be used as identifier for the model weights and tracking. By default, the data in ```data/``` will be used.

### Background
Melt ponds are pools of water on Arctic sea ice that have a strong influence on the Arctic energy budget by increasing the amount of sunlight that is absorbed. 
Accurate quantitative analysis of melt ponds is important for improving Arctic climate model predictions.
Infrared imagery can be used to derive melt pond parameters and thermal properties.
